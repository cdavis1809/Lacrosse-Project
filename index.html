            <h2>What is Lacrosse?</h2>
            <h3>- A BRIEF OVERVIEW -</h3>
            <p>
              Lacrosse is a team sport played with a netted-stick and a hard
              rubber ball. It is the oldest organized sport in North America,
              with its b vgnorigins with the indigenous people of North America
              as early as the 12th century. Lacrosse is a very fast game, the
              object of which is to send the ball through the opponents’ goal as
              many times as possible and to prevent one’s opponents from
              scoring. The goal is defined by uprights and a crossbar framing a
              loose net.
              <br />
              <br />
              The distinctive feature of this game is the crosse (lacrosse
              stick), which is the implement used by the players to carry,
              catch, and pass the ball. The crosse was originally a staff that
              was sharply bent at the top to form a hook. Today the shaft is
              made of metal and is attached to a plastic frame. String is woven
              through the hook/head on the end of the stick to form a net where
              the ball is caught, thrown, and carried.

          <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
          <h2>Men's VS. Women's</h2>
          <p>
            The equipment needed for men's lacrosse versus women's lacrosse is
            different due to the differences in the rules, regulations, and
            style of play.
